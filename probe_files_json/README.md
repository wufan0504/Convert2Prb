# Flatiron probe file format

- Array elements in `channel`, `x`, `y`, `z`, `shank` are ordered by the site number.
- Zero-based array indexing is used for `channel` and `shank` arrays. 
- Probe files were auto-generated by `irc2 export-probe` command, and converted from the IronClust & [JRCLUST probe files](https://github.com/JaneliaSciComp/JRCLUST/wiki/Probe-file) in `matlab/prb` directory.
- Each probe file (.json format) contains the following fields.
  
|Field name |Description |Format |Example |
|----|----|----|----|
|`format_version` |Name of the probe format and version |string |"flatiron-probe-0.2" |
|`probe_name` |[Probe name]-[Manufacturer acronym] |string |int128-8dbc |
|`probe_type` |Probe type: {"siprobe", "mea", "tetrode", "monotrode"} |string |"siprobe" |
|`channel` |Channel numbers in the recording file |array: num_site x 1| [0,1,2,3...]
|`x` |X-position of sites in micrometer |array: num_site x 1| [0,25,50,75,...]
|`y` |Y-position (parallel to the probe axis) of sites in micrometer |array: num_site x 1| [0,25,50,75,...]
|`z` |Z-position (normal to the probe surface) of sites in micrometer |array: num_site x 1| [0,25,50,75,...]
|`group`| Shank group numbers for each site | array: num_site x 1| [0,0,0,0,...]
|`site_width`| width of all sites in micrometers | scalar | 11
|`site_height`| height of all sites in micrometers |scalar | 15
